#Mondrals

**Simple Game Based on Mondrian Generator**

Once I had my [mondrian generator](http://jordanjwatkins.github.io/mondrian-generator/) working, I wanted to take it further and use it as the level generator for something a bit more game-like than just fitting rectangles in a bigger rectangle. So I set up a game loop, basic gravity and collisions and borrowed a sprite from Lemmings (one of my favorites as a youngster) to make the game Mondrals. 

It still needs a lot more work to be all it can be and the demo level is a bit too challenging if you've never played, but it's a basic functioning game and I learned a ton building it. Hopefully, I will get a chance to flesh it out in the future.
